The last year I've been learning a lot about Zig, this year I've tried to learn and use Rust at work to write some scripts.
Here is a list of things that worked for me in this process of learn these two languages.

## What it worked?

- Complete a lang-lings project, one of the best ways to get familiar with the syntax of the language is find a lang-lings repo where you can learn while you code to fix or achieve some kind of problem presented by the author of the repo.
  examples:
  - <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises">Ziglings</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">Rustlings</a>
- Code easy to hard algorithms, implement data structures, look how these things are implemented in the standard lib of the language.  
  Some examples that I've donde readind hashing algorithms papers:
  - <a href="https://github.com/axlEscalada/data-structure-zig/blob/main/sha256.zig">Implementation of sha256 hash algorithm from scratch</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/axlEscalada/data-structure-zig/blob/main/hmac.zig">Implementation of hmac algorithm</a>
- Find a open source project written with this language and try to contribute! you could fix some bugs or implement new features.
  Here are some examples of my contributions to bun project using zig:
