The last year I've been learning Zig in my free time and here are some of my toughts on how is the best approach to learn a new language.
Here is a list of things that worked for me in this process of learn Zig.

## What it worked?

- Complete a \<lang\>-lings project, one of the best ways to get familiar with the syntax of the language is find a lang-lings repo where you can learn while you code to fix or achieve some kind of problem presented in the excercises.  
  Examples:
  - <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises">Ziglings</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">Rustlings</a>
- Implement algorithms and data structures, look how these things are implemented in the standard lib of the language.  
  Some examples that I've done:
  - <a href="https://github.com/axlEscalada/data-structure-zig/blob/main/sha256.zig">Implementation of sha256 hash algorithm from scratch</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/axlEscalada/data-structure-zig/blob/main/hmac.zig">Implementation of hmac algorithm</a>
- Find an open source project written with this language and try to contribute! you could fix some bugs or implement new features. You can also check commits and prs to get familiar with the conventions and good practices.  
  Here are some examples of my contributions to bun project using Zig:

  - <a href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3AaxlEscalada">Contributions to bun project</a>

- Write posts while you're learning, in this way you can document what you learnt and share knowledge with teammates.
- Find the spaces where the community chat, change opinions, report bugs and ask for help. A good start point are the issues on github, also usually the community have an slack, a discord or and IRC channel.
- Follow people on social media related to the develop of the language, or people that is learning same as you.
